# Challenge 2: Basic Calculator

**Objective**: Create a function `basicCalculator` that takes three arguments: two numbers and a string representing an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and returns the result of the operation.

**Requirements**:

- The function should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If the operator is not one of the four basic operators, the function should return `null`.

**Example**:

```javascript
basicCalculator(10, 5, "+"); // should return 15
```
